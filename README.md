<h2> Name and Description </h2>
<h2> travelDash2.0 </h2>
<p> This is a full stack application for Travel Agents to keep track of their clients information stored in clients profiles. It will allow agents to create, edit, update and delete clients profiles based on a variety of information necessary to book travel. There will aso be a search page using Googles API for agents to locate hotels or restaurants in that area. </p>
<br>
<h2> Wireframes and Video Tour of Application </h2>
<p>Included in wireframes folder</p><br>

<h2>User Stories</h2>
<p>Agents will be able to view all clients in database as well as create new ones. Also, the agent will have to option to delete and edit clients when necessary. They will have the option to login based on their credentials used when signing up.</p><br>
<h2>Future Build Out</h2>
<p> Clients will be able to perfrom CRUD functions on their own profile and also view agents profiles and connect with them. There will also be a page where clients can perform searches for hotels and restaurants. The clients will then be able to attach comments that will be added to their profile for agents to plan travel itineraries. Another feature that I would like to implement is a way to have multiple agents that would have their own database of clients accesible through a login.
<h2> Technologies Used </h2>
<p> The technologies used in this project are Node.js, Express, Ejs, Javascript, PostgreSQL, CSS, Flexbox, and Bulma. The application also uses Authentication for users to have their own personalized client database. These techonologies will utilize the MVC model within the structure of the application. <p>
<h2> Database structure </h2>
<p> My databases are going to include a client table as well as a type of client table which will link the client to the type of travel they are inrterested in. I will also have a table which can keep track of users and their stored passwords.</p>
